Inspiration:
We've purchased products off Amazon based on their good reviews only to find that they don't perform to the level portrayed by the comments. We wanted to create a solution to inaccurate ratings created by overly positive and overly negative reviewers.

What it does:
Our program gets all the reviews for a product on Amazon and puts the review comment and the star rating into a data frame. The program then performs a sentiment analysis on the data frame and returns a mean based on the wording of the reviews and three graphs the give a deeper look into the data.

What's next:
We hope to improve the algorithms in the Amazon Review Judger. When web scraping from products that have a large amount of reviews, it takes extremely long due to the inefficiency of our algorithms as we go through every review twice for the web scraping alone. We hope we can reduce this to only one visit to each review.
